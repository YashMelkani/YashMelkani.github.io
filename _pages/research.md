Below is a list of my current and past research as well as some personal projects.

Machine Learning of Contractile Dynamics in Drosophila Heart
======
The Drosophila model has proven tremendously powerful for understanding and developing treatments for several human disorders, including cardiovascular disease and aging. Relevant advanced high-speed imaging and high-throughput lab assays generate large volumes of high-resolution videos, necessitating next-generation methods for rapid analysis. I work on developing deep learning techniques for the automatic segmentation of heart walls in drosophila cardiac recordings. These segmentations are used to calculate important diagnostic cardiac parameters for cardiac aging.
