Below is a list of my current and past research as well as some personal projects.

Machine Learning of Contractile Dynamics in Drosophila Heart
======
The Drosophila model has proven tremendously powerful for understanding and developing treatments for several human disorders, including cardiovascular disease and aging. Relevant advanced high-speed imaging and high-throughput lab assays generate large volumes of high-resolution videos, necessitating next-generation methods for rapid analysis. I work on developing deep learning techniques for the automatic segmentation of heart walls in drosophila cardiac recordings. These segmentations are used to calculate important diagnostic cardiac parameters for cardiac aging.

Machine Learning for Particle Physics
======
While exploring the field of machine learning for particle physics, I have implemented several ML techniques to analyze publically available data from CERN. Some of these techniques are displayed below. This was done to develop familiarity with some commonly used ML strategies.
